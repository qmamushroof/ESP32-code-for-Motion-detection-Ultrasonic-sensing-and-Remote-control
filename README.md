# ESP32 Motion Detection, Ultrasonic Sensing, and Remote Control

This code allows you to connect devices using an ESP32 and Sinric Pro via the internet for remote control. It integrates motion detection with a PIR sensor and distance measurement using an ultrasonic sensor to automate device control.

## Features
- Remote control of devices through Sinric Pro.
- Motion detection using a PIR sensor.
- Distance measurement with an ultrasonic sensor.
- Automatic control of connected devices based on sensor input.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository**:
